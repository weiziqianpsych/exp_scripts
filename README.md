# exp_scripts

These are some experimental scripts I made via PsychoPy. I removed the pictures and sound materials for confidentiality.

- DCCS_version_A/B: The dimensional change card sort game.
- Mental_rotation: The mental rotation game. 
- Raven_test: Raven's test.
- SVT: visual matching game.
- Visual_perception: For each trial, a composite graph is given and you need to find simple polygons like triangles which can be combined into the composite one. These are multiple choice type questions.
